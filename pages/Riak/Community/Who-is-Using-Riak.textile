[[Widescript|http://www.widescript.com]] is a digital reading application targeted to people who study or make use of reference material. It allows them to interact with their texts, everywhere. The development of the idea started in early 2010 and the application is currently in private beta.

*From Lead Developer Francisco Treacy:* "As Riak is content-type agnostic and excels at consistency/availability fine-tuning, it is being used to persist several kinds of data in Widescript's application - logging, user metadata, multimedia assets. Not only it was chosen for its distributed nature, but because it goes hand in hand with Widescript's Javascript development stack."

Based in Seatlle, [[SwingVine|http://swingvine.com]] helps you discover new music, movies, books, fashion, wines, and more. SwingVine shows you what's hot in each category and then shows you the connections or vines between what you're already looking at and unexplored content that you might enjoy.  SwingVine then lets you personalize your discovery experience by incorporating your friends.

*From Co-Founder Alan McConnell:* "We've had a fantastic experience using Riak for a media scrapbook product we've recently released called SwingVine Gallery. Our legacy image storage system is over 10K lines of C++ code, and using Riak we were able to replace it with a system that is less than 1000 lines of python and performs better, scales better, and is more durable.  All of our users' scrapbook media (video, images and audio) data/metadata for the SwingVine Gallery product is housed in Riak.

[[Rigel Group|http://rigelgroupllc.com]] is a small, high-impact software development company based in Carlsbad, CA. We help clients leverage cutting-edge technologies and cloud-based architectures to build high-performance, large-scale applications at absurdly low costs.

*From Rigel Group CTO John Lynch:* "One of our favorite tools is the Riak distributed key/value data store. Riak's incredibly low operational costs allow clients who do not have dedicated, high-end system administration resources to still deploy large-scale, data-heavy applications. This "democratization" of Big Data is allowing smaller firms to compete with the big guys. Having a company as developer-friendly as Basho stand behind the product is also a huge win for us."

[[/attachments/overnothing_logo.png|align=center|width=100|vspace=70px]]





[[Division by Zero|http://overnothing.com/]] is a software consultancy based in New York state that specializes in Ruby/Rails application deployments, architecture & infrastructure planning consulting, and Web application Development.

*From Division by Zero Founder Wayne Seguin*: "One system we built integrates Postgresql, Redis and Riak as backends to several applications (including a few Ruby on Rails web applications). Postgresql is used for driving several E/R modeled applications from the same central database. Redis is used as a distributed queue system. And Riak is used for data sets that we do not want adding load to the master Postgresql database as well as for storing result sets as detailed below.

There are a several web and API applications that run off of the Postgresql database where entities and their relationships are stored. Agents run on many servers across multiple data centers. These agents submit data into a centralized Redis queue. Then several worker daemons process the data from the queues and update the database based on the information gained from the collected data.

There are many background processes (some services, some run run as cronjobs) which query the Postgresql database server in order to extract data sets, potentially very large.  These extracted data sets are stored in Riak. After the data sets are stored in the Riak system, there are several reporting / aggregating (long running) processes which load the data sets from Riak. The processes compute their results and then store them back in Riak either for further processing or for retrieval. Riak keys for the results are sent to the Postgresql system thus linking the Riak result sets with the Entities they are related to in Postgresql."

[[DigiTar|http://digitar.com/]] is a messaging and web security company based in Boise, Idaho. DigiTar services enhance existing messaging and web systems with next-generation feature sets, through state-of-the-art technology development.

*From COO/CTO Jason Williams* : When we started in 2004, there weren't any open-source data stores that had built-in fault-tolerance or clustering that didn't involve some form of shared storage infrastructure.  This necessitated building our own homegrown partitioning and failover mechanisms to provide the reliability of a shared-nothing architecture. However, this approach has required a significant commitment to maintaining these solutions and keeping them working with the latest versions of MySQL. 

By basing all of our new services and APIs on Riak, we've been able to focus our energies on the features our customers want, instead of keeping the infrastructure under them available. Our customers rely on us to keep their businesses functioning 24/7...and Riak has made it possible to do that without custom clustering solutions and black magic.

Riak has allowed us to focus on what we love to do - building awesome services for our customers - and less time on making the datastore behind those services always available.
