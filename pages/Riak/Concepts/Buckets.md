# Buckets

Buckets are used to define a virtual keyspace and provide the ability to define
isolated non-default configuration. Buckets might be compared to tables or
folders in relational databases or file systems, respectively. Buckets with
default configuration are essentially free, while non-default configuration
will be gossiped around the ring.

## Configuration

For each bucket a number of configuration properties can be defined overriding
the defaults.

**n_val**

*integer* (default: `3`). Specifies the number of copies of each object to be
stored in the cluster. See [Replication](Replication).

**allow_mult**

*boolean* (default: `false`). Determines whether sibling values can be created.
See [Siblings](Vector-Clocks#Siblings).

**last_write_wins**

*boolean* (default: `false`). Indicates if an object's vector clocks will be
used to decide the canonical write based on time of write in the case of a
conflict. See [Conflict resolution](Concepts#Conflict-resolution).

**r**, **w**, **dw**, **rw**

`all`, `quorum`, `one`, or and *integer* (default: `quorum`). Sets read and
write failure tolerance settings. See [Reading Data](Concepts#Reading-Data) and
[Writing and Updating Data](Concepts#Writing-and-Updating-Data).

**precommit**

A list of erlang or javascript functions to be executed before writing an
object. See [Pre-Commit Hooks](Commit-Hooks#Pre-Commit-Hooks).

**postcommit**

A list of erlang functions to be executed after writing an object. See
[Post-Commit Hooks](Commit-Hooks#Post-Commit-Hooks)).

or the documentation for your client driver.
