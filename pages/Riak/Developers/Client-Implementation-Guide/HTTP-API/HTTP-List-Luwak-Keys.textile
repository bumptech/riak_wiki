h1. HTTP List Luwak Keys

Lists known Luwak objects.

<div class="info">This feature is currently only available in development versions of Riak.</div>

h2. Request

```bash
GET /luwak?keys=true     # List all keys
GET /luwak?keys=stream   # Stream keys to the client
```

Required query parameters:

* @keys@ - defaults to @false@. When set to @true@ all keys will be returned in a single payload.  When set to @stream@, keys will be returned in chunked-encoding, similarly to [[HTTP List Keys]].

Optional query parameters:

* @props@ - defaults to @true@, which will also return [[Luwak properties|HTTP Get Luwak Properties]] in the response. Set to @false@ to suppress properties in the response.

h2. Response

Normal response codes:

* @200 OK@

Important headers:

* @Content-Type@ - @application/json@
* @Transfer-Encoding@ - @chunked@ when the @keys@ query parameter is set to @stream@.

The JSON object in the response will contain up to two entries, @"props"@ and @"keys"@ which are present or missing according to the query parameters.  If @keys=stream@ in the query parameters, multiple JSON objects in chunked-encoding will be returned containing @"keys"@ properties.
