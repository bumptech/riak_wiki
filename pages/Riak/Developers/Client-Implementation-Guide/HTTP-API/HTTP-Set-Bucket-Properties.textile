h1. HTTP Set Bucket Properties

Sets bucket properties like "n_val" and "allow_mult".

h2. Request

```bash
PUT /riak/bucket
```

Important headers:
* @Content-Type@ - @application/json@

The body of the request should be a JSON object with a single entry "props".  Unmodified bucket properties may be omitted.

Available properties:

* @n_val@ (integer > 0) - the number of replicas for objects in this bucket
* @allow_mult@ (true or false) - whether to allow sibling objects to be created (concurrent updates)
* @last_write_wins@ (true or false) - whether to ignore object history (vector clock) when writing
* @precommit@ - [[precommit hooks|Pre- and Post-Commit Hooks]]
* @postcommit@ - [[postcommit hooks|Pre- and Post-Commit Hooks]]
* @r, w, dw, rw@ - default quorum values for operations on keys in the bucket. Valid values are:
** @"all"@ - all nodes must respond
** @"quorum"@ - (n_val/2) + 1 nodes must respond. *This is the default.*
** @"one"@ - equivalent to 1
** _Any integer_ - must be less than or equal to n_val
* @backend@ - when using @riak_kv_multi_backend@, which named backend to use for the bucket

Other properties do exist but are not commonly modified.

<div class="title">Property types</div>
Make sure you use the proper types for attributes like *n_val* and *allow_mult*. If you use strings instead of integers and booleans respectively, you may see some odd errors in your logs, saying something like @"{badarith,[{riak_kv_util,normalize_rw_value,2},]}"@.
</div>

h2. Response

Normal status codes:
* @204 No Content@

Typical error codes:
* @400 Bad Request@ - if the submitted JSON is invalid
* @415 Unsupported Media Type@ - if the Content-Type was not set to application/json in the request

If successful, no content will be returned in the response body.
