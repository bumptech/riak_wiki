h1. HTTP Delete Object

Deletes an object from the specified bucket / key.

h2. Request

```
DELETE /riak/bucket/key
```

Optional query parameters:
* @rw@ - quorum for both operations (get and put) involved in deleting an object. (default is set at the bucket level)

h2. Response

Normal response codes:

* @204 No Content@
* @404 Not Found@

Typical error codes:

* @400 Bad Request@ - e.g. when rw parameter is invalid (> N)

@404@ responses are "normal" in the sense that DELETE operations are idempotent and not finding the resource has the same effect as deleting it.

h4. Example

$ curl -v -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/test/test2
