<div id="toc"></div>

h2. Erlang

The local Erlang client is a tightly-integrated part of Riak and the Riak HTTP and Protocol Buffers interfaces use the Erlang client internally.

The primary client for code that is not inside Riak is the PBC client:

* [[riak-erlang-client on GitHub|https://github.com/basho/riak-erlang-client]]
* [[Erlang Protocol Buffers Client Documentation|Erlang Client PBC]]

We also [[host the generated Erlang Client API Docs on GitHub|http://basho.github.com/riak-erlang-client/]].


h2. Javascript

The officially supported Javascript client uses [[jQuery|http://jquery.com]] for communicating with Riak via Ajax.

The [[riak-javascript-client on GitHub|https://github.com/basho/riak-javascript-client]] is the main location for code and documentation.

There is a JavaScript sample app called [[yakriak|http://github.com/seancribbs/yakriak]], a Riak-powered Ajax-polling chatroom.

<div class="info">There is also a mature, heavily-developed Node.js client for Riak called [[riak.js|http://riakjs.org]]</div>


h2. Java

The [[riak-java-client repo on GitHub|http://github.com/basho/riak-java-client]] is the home for code and documentation. The README should get you up and and running.
