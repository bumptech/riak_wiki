The following steps should get you up and running with Riak on Debian or Ubuntu 9.10.  You can install from source or from our custom .deb package.

h2. From our custom .deb package

To install from our pre-built package, run these commands for the appropriate platform:

h3. 64-bit


```bash
$ wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-0.14/riak_0.14.2-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i riak_0.14.2-1_amd64.deb
```


h3. 32-bit


```bash
$ wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-0.14/riak_0.14.2-1_i386.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i riak_0.14.2-1_i386.deb
```

h2. From source

Riak requires [[Erlang|http://www.erlang.org/]] R13B04 or later. If you do not have Erlang already installed, see [[Installing Erlang]]. Don't worry, it's easy!

Let's install the dependencies that we can from apt:


```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev-i386
```

If you have not installed Erlang, please [[do so|Installing Erlang]].

Now we can download and install Riak:

```bash
$ wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-0.14/riak-0.14.2.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf riak-0.14.2.tar.gz
$ cd riak-0.14.2
$ make rel
```

There should now be a fresh build of Riak in the rel/riak directory.
