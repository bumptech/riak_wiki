The following steps should get you up and running with Riak on SuSE.

Riak may be unofficially installed on the following x86/x86_64 flavors of SuSE via community provided support:
* SLES11-SP1
* OpenSUSE 11.2
* OpenSUSE 11.3
* OpenSUSE 11.4

The Riak package and all of its dependencies (including the base Erlang) can be found in an OpenSUSE Build Service (http://build.opensuse.org) Zypper repository

(The following commands are assumed to be run as root)

h2. Add the Riak zypper repository

```bash
$ zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/database/$distro Riak
```
Where $distro is one of:
* SLE_11_SP1
* openSUSE_11.2
* openSUSE_11.3
* openSUSE_11.4

NOTE: The first time you try to use the repository after adding it to your
system, you may be asked to accept the GPG key for the repo.

h2. Install the Riak package

```bash
$ zypper in riak
```

This should automatically pull in its dependencies, including erlang if you do
not already have it installed.

h2. (Optional) Enable "refresh" on the riak repository to receive updates

```bash
$ zypper mr -r Riak
```
