The following steps should get you up and running with Riak Search on CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Please note, CentOS enables SE Linux by default and you may need to disable SE Linux if you encounter errors.

h2. Source Install

Riak Search requires [[Erlang|http://www.erlang.org/]] R13B04 or later. If you do not have Erlang already installed, see [[Installing Erlang]].

Building from source also requires the following packages:
* gcc
* gcc-c++
* glibc-devel
* make
* ant

You can install these as follows:


```bash
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ glibc-devel make ant
```


<div class="info">Installing Ant will also install the OpenJDK version of Java.</div>


Now we can download and install Riak Search:


```bash
wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak-search/riak-search-0.14/riak_search-0.14.2.tar.gz
tar zxvf riak_search-0.14.2.tar.gz
cd riak_search-0.14.2
make rel
```

There should now be a fresh build of Riak Search in the rel/riaksearch directory.
