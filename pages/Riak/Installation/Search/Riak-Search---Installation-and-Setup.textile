<div class="note"><div class="title">Can I Install Search on an Existing Cluster?</div>We currently don't officially support "installing" Riak Search in an existing Riak KV cluster. If you are adventurous, the basic approach would be to shut down the cluster, move your data directory somewhere safe, uninstall Riak KV, install Riak Search, and move the data directory back, taking care to name all nodes the same.</div>


h2. Starting Riak Search

To start up a Riak Search node, change directory as necessary to where you installed Riak Search (in the source directory, it's {{rel/riaksearch/bin}}) and run the {{riaksearch}} command like so:


```bash
riaksearch start
```


To run Riak Search with an interactive Erlang console:


```bash
riaksearch console
```


Once your node has started, you can double-check that it is running using:


```bash
riaksearch ping
```


The command will respond with @pong@ if the node is running, or @pang@ if it is not.
