## Philosophy

Riak is designed to make operations as easy as possible. With a good
understanding of Riak, appropriate capacity planning, and suitable redundancy,
operations can be a 9-5 job. Ops teams should be able to rest easy with the
knowledge that they are running a fault tolerant system with predictable failure
states that should never comprise their data. When the 2AM phone call comes in
that the server hosting a Riak node has gone down, panic need not ensue.
Instead, you can fix or replace the failed server in the morning, confident that
your data will all be there when you get into the office.
